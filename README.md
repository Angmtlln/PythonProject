## Features

+ Telegram Bot Integration: The project includes a Telegram bot that users can interact with by sending photos to receive drawn with strokes versions.
+ Neural Network Image Conversion: The bot utilizes a trained neural network model to convert the received photo into a drawn with strokes representation.
+ Real-Time Processing: The image conversion process happens in real-time, allowing users to receive the transformed image shortly after uploading.
+ Interactive User Experience: The bot provides a user-friendly interface + where users can easily submit their photos and receive the converted images.
+ Error Handling: The system includes robust error handling to ensure smooth operation, providing informative feedback to users in case of any issues.
  
## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, ensure that you have the following components installed:

+ Python 3.7 or higher
+ Telegram API token (obtainable through the Telegram BotFather)
+ Neural network model trained for image conversion (e.g., Pix2Pix or any other image-to-image translation model)
